To use this extension, you need to create or add three icon files in this directory:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editing software or online icon generators.

The icons should represent your Colonist Card Counter extension.

For a quick solution, you can use a simple colored square with "CC" text as the icon.

-----

If you have ImageMagick installed:
- You can run the create_icons.sh script in this directory
- Run: chmod +x create_icons.sh && ./create_icons.sh

If you don't have icons ready, the extension will still work, but it will use Chrome's default extension icon.
